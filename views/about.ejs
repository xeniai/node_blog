      <h5 class="card-title">About Me</h5>
      <p class="card-text">I create api servers using nodejs, npm, express, and python. I use java, javascript, mongodb and html too in creating applications. Iâ€™m learning react. I love to work on linux with vi editor. Thank you to all my Udemy teachers, I can always go back and rewind the class if I forgot some of the syntaxes and copy the quintessential codes at hand. Thank you Heroku, Mongodb, to the community developers and open-source links available. I love to collaborate with people who think with intentions, without inhibitions and backdoors. Having said this, I don't like plastic literally and figuratively. I believe that everybody should respect each other regardless of their race, gender, jobs, status in life, and beliefs. Let's join forces, contact me through this email: xenia.iporac@gmail.com, and make things happen.</p>
